# ss14-teach-and-learn
A dummy repository as an example for new PRs.

# What is the purpose of this repository?
This repository is accessible by anyone who wishes to learn how to make proper PRs and learn the Git version control system, from forking, making a PR, all the way to merge.





## PR Prerequisites
There are a few key things to keep in mind before submitting a PR. You will need a GitHub account in order to make PRs, then clone this repository and make a new branch off of `main`. You can do this by running `git branch (branch name)` and then `git switch (branch name)`. None of your changes will be touching main.

Your objective after obtaining the files will be to make a new folder in the `characters` folder, with a .txt file in it. Name the folder your character name. All the prerequisites in the .txt file are as follows:

First, write down a character name and a small descriptor/backstory of that character plus your discord username to confirm that it is indeed you that is making the changes.

Secondly, make sure whatever changes you have made are committed to your fork.

Lastly, make a PR! Your PR will be accepted once all conditions are met.
